    In this paper, the goal is to create a mathematical apparatus that
    will be able to iterate over various functions. We also find an 
    application for the reformulation of Multonimial theorem and the
    nth derivative of nested exponentials. Also through this operator
    we will be able to unify the sum and the product, or the analogy 
    for the exponential case, with only one Symbol.

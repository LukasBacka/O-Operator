\section{Introduction}

\begin{definition}
      Let us have an O  operator
      
      \begin{align}
            \biigO_{t = 1}^m g(f(t) \ o \  
            \lambda) := g(f(1) \ o \  g(f(2)
            \ o \   g(... g(f(m) )...)))
      \end{align}
      
      where o is some binary arithmetic operation. 
      We will \(f(t)\) call as nucleus, \(\lambda\)
      as the tail, and g(.) as surface. The tail is
      where the operator will iterate.
\end{definition}

through this definition we are able
to define a summation operator and
a product operator as

\begin{align}
      \sum_{i=1}^m f(i) &= \biigO_{i=1}^m f(i) + \lambda \\
      \prod_{i=1}^m f(i) &= \biigO_{i=1}^m f(i)\times \lambda
\end{align}
